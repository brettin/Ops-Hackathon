Hi Everyone,

I want to welcome everyone in advance to the Ops Hackathon that will take place tomorrow from 10am-4pm in room 1416, building 240 (the large TCS conference room). 

We will be working tomorrow on 5 data sets, each with its own prediction target. We will break up into 5 teams each focusing on a different data set. The teams will have a mix of CELS and BIS staff. There will be one BIS staff on each team that knows the data and prediction target(s) deeply. Matthew will send out more information on the data sets later today.

For those of you who are new to python's machine learning libraries, I've included here for convenience a script that will set up a python environment for you. This environment contains commonly used machine learning libraries including those for deep learning. When running the script, just agree to the terms and accept all defaults.

The scripts are for Mac or Linux users. Unfortunately, we are unable to support Windows users as we have. The scripts assume the bash shell, but it should be straightforward to modify it for other shells (there is just one line where the PATH environment variable is updated in a shell specific manner). Some of us will arrive early tomorrow, and we can assist anyone who is having problems setting up their python environment.

For further reading on setting up your python environment, a very well documented installation process is located at:

Welcome to the Ops Hackathon.

We will be working tomorrow on 5 data sets, each with it's own
prediction target. We will break up into 5 teams each focusing
on a different data set. The teams will have a mix of CELS and
BIS staff. There will be one BIS staff on each team that knows
the data and prediction target(s) deeply.

For those of you who are new to python's machine learning
libraries, I've included here for convience a script that
will set up a python environment for you. This environment
contains commonly used machine learning libraries including
those for deep learning.

The scripts are for mac or linux users. Unfortuantely,
we are unable to support windows users. The scripts assume
the bash shell, but it should be straightforward to modify
it for other shells.

Some of us will arrive early tomorrow, and we can assist
anyone who is having problems setting up their python
environment.

For further reading on setting up your python environment,
a very well documented installation process is located
at:

Conda:
For Conda, the following would be the best place to install and get started:
Installation:

( I would recommend having beginners use the Anaconda installer rather than Miniconda as they would not need to hunt for packages. This also has a windows installer though I have no experience with this.)
